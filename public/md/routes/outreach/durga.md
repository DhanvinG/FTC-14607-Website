# Durga Temple

Durga Temple Demos and workshops, Host: Our team engaged in workshops with children at the Durga Temple in Fairfax Station, VA. We set up a variety of activities with different difficulty levels, so students of all ages and skill levels could participate and enjoy themselves. We brought marshmallow tower challenges, speed-CAD contests, and block coding lessons to the Temple.

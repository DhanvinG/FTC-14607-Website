# INMED

Working with INMED, an afterschool program for low-income families, we hosted sessions to teach structural support and introduced the concepts of FIRST and robotics to the children involved. Our goal was to provide not only knowledge but also inspiration to underserved students, empowering them with the skills and mindset needed to pursue STEM opportunities in the future.
